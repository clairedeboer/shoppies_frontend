# Shoppies Frontend

This application was built in React and allows users to search OMDB's API and nominate movies. There is a [Rails backend] (https://github.com/clairedeboer/shoppies_backend) that allows a user to save their nominations list if they leave the page. I used Semantic UI for styling. 

The component tree is outlined below

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
